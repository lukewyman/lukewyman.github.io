## The Karaoke Suite
At the beginning of 2019, I started taking singing lessons. I went to karaoke a good three times a week as an outlet for my newfound hobby. Karaoke today is still in the dark ages. The song database is a set of large, black binders, and song requests are written in pencil on little pieces of paper and turned in to the DJ.  

By the end of 2019, I realized that the idea of a karaoke app would be an rich use case for applying my skills at application development. Now, with the revamp of my career in DevOps, I have purposed the karaoke concept as the foundation for a non-trivial, real-world project to showcase my skills in product concept realization, complex application architecture, DevOps with Terraform and AWS services, and applicaton development.

I have decomposed this effort into a suite of projects as the primary way of managing complexity. This is very much a work in progress and a learning experience. I'm having a lot of fun working on this effort. I hope you enjoy it, too!
