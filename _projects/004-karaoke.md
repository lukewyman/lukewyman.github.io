## The Karaoke Suite
At the beginning of 2019, I started taking singing lessons. Immersed in my new passion, I found myself attending karaoke evenings at several establishments around Capitol Hill, Denver. Karaoke is still very much a paper-and-pencil affair. It occurred to me that a good karaoke app would entail an phone app for patrons, where users can search for songs by title and artist "Spotify-style" and then choose a song and and request to be added to the DJ's queue. The DJ version of the app would allow the DJ to manage the queue from their end. 

Given my career revamp in DevOps and cloud computing with AWS services, I decided to implement my idea as a suite of projects that entail a microservices appliction along with other projects to implement the cloud infrastructure by means of Infrastructure as Code. What I like about what I've done here, is that I've created a fun, learning and training playground for myself where I can learn a host of DevOps and cloud computing technologies hands-on.

This is very much a work in progress and a learning experience. I'm having a lot of fun working on this effort. I hope you enjoy it, too!
