## Skills

### Programming Languages
- **Python** - strong intermediate - primary language. I use Python for writing AWS Lambdas, FastAPI apps, and some scripting.
- **Typescript** - a few months experience. I don't much fancy the Node ecosystem, but I can comfortable port Typescript examples to Python
- **Bash scripting** - I get by for now and do just fine using it in GitHub Actions and Dockerfiles, but I'd still like to beef up this skill and own it a bit more.
- **Legacy Languages: Java, Scala, C#/.NET** - While I no longer use these languages, I think my old-days app dev experience with them would be usesful to provide context for DevOps for these kinds of applications.

### DevOps

Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD Pipelines are my true love! I enjoy the simple pleasure of creating modules with Terraform, and then using the modules to compose more complex solutions with Terragrunt. 

- **Terraform**
- **Terragrunt**
- **GitHub Actions** 
- **CI/CD Concepts:** unit testing, integration testing, environment promotion
- **CloudFormation / AWS CDK**
- **Docker**

### Cloud Computing - AWS 

I am proficient at Infrastructure as Code with the following AWS services. I have hands-on experience building out the infrastructure for container-based web backends with Terraform, as well as building Serverless applications with AWS CDK or Serverless Stack.

**AWS Lambda & Serverless**
 - AWS Lambda w/ deployment as Docker images
 - AWS CDK and Serverless Stack framework

**APIs & Web App Infrastructure**
- Amazon API Gateway / OpenAPI / VTL Mapping Templates
- Amazon Route 53 / DNS
- Application Load Balancers
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

**Databases**
- Amazon Relational Data Service (RDS) / Postgresql 
- Amazon DynamoDB 
- Amazon DocumentDB / MongoDB
- Amazon OpenSearch Service

**Security**
- OAuth2 / OIDC
- AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Amazon Cognito

**Other**
- Amazon S3
- Amazon CloudWatch
- Amazon EventBridge
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

### Application Development

- FastAPI / Python / Pytest
- AWS Libraries: boto3, moto
- Database Libraries: motor (MongoDB), sqlalchemy
- Test-Driven Development / unit tests / integration tests
- Domain-Driven Design / Microservices
- Purpose-Built Databases
